\subsubsection*{Notes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Support for {\ttfamily int32}, {\ttfamily int64}, {\ttfamily float}, {\ttfamily double} and {\ttfamily std\+::string} is included for {\ttfamily push()} and {\ttfamily fetch()} {\itshape -\/like} functions. {\ttfamily push\+\_\+many()} and {\ttfamily fetch\+\_\+many()} do not work with {\ttfamily std\+::string} as they use {\ttfamily numpy} arrays, which do not play well with strings at the {\ttfamily pybind11} level.
\item Only {\ttfamily sampler\+\_\+exact} and {\ttfamily chrono\+\_\+sampler\+\_\+exact} classes work with {\ttfamily std\+::string} type.
\item Interfaces can be configured to be {\ttfamily 1d}, {\ttfamily 2d} or {\ttfamily 3d} and to use {\ttfamily float} or {\ttfamily double} for point arithmetics and time stamps.
\item A {\ttfamily mui4py-\/demos} folder has been included in the {\ttfamily mui-\/demos} repository under the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{namespacemui4py}{mui4py}} branch.
\item There has been a few additions/modifications to the previous code base of the library. Some of them were to include useful functionality to the bindings and others to correct {\itshape buggy} code (mostly due to inconsistency with typing).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Extra functionality}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily push\+\_\+many()} and {\ttfamily fetch\+\_\+many()} functions. They can push/fetch a list of values at different locations using C looping. They can provide great speedups with respect to python loops. They make use of {\ttfamily numpy.\+ndarray} .
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{mui4py_8cpp_a4f5bdc6ba531d7e2906570602a6c5573}{get\+\_\+mpi\+\_\+version()}}, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{mui4py_8cpp_a2c6efd70ef12dc0a86693f6189af31f8}{get\+\_\+compiler\+\_\+version()}}and {\ttfamily get\+\_\+compiler\+\_\+info()} provide compile-\/time information about {\ttfamily \hyperlink{namespacemui4py}{mui4py}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Missing functionality}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Boolean {\ttfamily OR} operations of {\ttfamily shape} classes.
\item {\ttfamily or\+\_\+set} class.
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{namespacemui_1_1geometry_a64dc85b99c0470026ea1e60d51acc086}{collide()}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Building}

\subsubsection*{General}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bindings tested with\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily gcc 7.\+2.\+0} and {\ttfamily clang L\+L\+VM version 9.\+1.\+0}, but it should work with any version of them supporting {\ttfamily c++11}.
\item {\ttfamily Mpich 3.\+2.\+1}, {\ttfamily Open\+M\+PI 3.\+1.\+0} and {\ttfamily Spectrum M\+PI 10.\+02}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item It is advised to use {\bfseries conda} or {\bfseries virtualenv} environments. This will provide isolation and control over the dependencies.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Dependencies}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item mpi4py (3.\+0.\+0)
\item numpy ($>$1.\+13)
\item pybind11 (only at compile time) $>$ {\ttfamily mpi4py} package should be compiled with the same compiler and M\+PI version as {\ttfamily \hyperlink{namespacemui4py}{mui4py}}. Not keeping this consistency could lead into non-\/trivial runtime errors. Use {\ttfamily mpi4py.\+get\+\_\+config()} and {\ttfamily mui4py.\+get\+\_\+compiler\+\_\+config()}, {\ttfamily mui4py.\+get\+\_\+compiler\+\_\+version()}, {\ttfamily mui4py.\+get\+\_\+mpi\+\_\+version()} to gather compile-\/time information.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape Note\+: Indicated versions in brackets are orientative. It might work for earlier versions as well.}

\subsubsection*{Compiling just the binary module (option 1)}


\begin{DoxyCode}
make COMPILER=[GCC|CLANG] mui4py\_mod
export PYTHONPATH=/pathToMUI/wrappers/Python/mui4py
\end{DoxyCode}


\#\#\# Create python package (option 2) 
\begin{DoxyCode}
make COMPILER=[GCC|CLANG] package
make pip-install # To install with pip the created package
\end{DoxyCode}
